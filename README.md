## About The Project
Vue Otasoft is a Nuxt.js (Vue.js) based PWA frontend for Online Travel Agencies (OTA's). Thanks to the good design patterns, responsive web desing, and mobile first approach, Vue Otasoft provides:

* SEO - thanks to Server Side Rendering
* PWA - looks and works almost like a native mobile application
* Performance - fast loading speed thanks to SSR, Lazy Load, and conditional rendering

Vue Otasoft is built using:

* Nuxt.js (Vue.js)
* TypeScript
* SASS
* Jest
* Cypress
* i18n

Otasoft projects are and always will be open source (MIT Licence). Anyone can use and support the project. The project is currently in the development phase.
